# AwesomeML-algo-book
[fork my repository](https://github.com/user/repository/fork)
A book where you can find all type definition and information about ml algorithms. I gather the information from stack overflow,scikit-learn and other creative commons sources.Countributions welcome.

The book can be found here: https://archlinuxlove.gitbook.io/awesome-ml-algo/

## Introduction

Machine learning is currently on the trend and a awesome technology , which solves many problem. Now these days many people want to learn and learning the ml. So making their learning easy and also making a open source encyclopedia of machine learning algorithms , I created this project.

## Book structure

The structure I am thinking is pretty straight forward , for a algorithm a separate page. That's way we can create a very clear and valuable information book where anyone can find information regarding the algorithms.

## List Of Algorithms

- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/sparkingdark/AwesomeML-algo-book/blob/main/docs/linear%20regression.md)
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/sparkingdark/AwesomeML-algo-book/blob/main/docs/logistic%20regression.md)
- [K means Clustering](./docs/k_means_clustering.md)
- [Ridge Regression](./docs/ridge_regression.md)

## Interesting Github repo list: [github repos and gitbooks](./github_repo.md)

## Reference & Open source Github repo used:

## How to be a contributor?

As it's a open source project,open source contributions are openly welcome.If you have an idea of a algorithm please open a issue or a pr at https://github.com/sparkingdark/AwesomeML-algo-book .
